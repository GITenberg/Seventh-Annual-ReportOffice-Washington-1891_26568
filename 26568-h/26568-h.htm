<p>The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, in accordance with act of Congress, was continued during the
fiscal year 1885&ndash;’86.</p>

<p>The general plan upon which the work has been prosecuted in former
years, and which has been explained in earlier reports, was continued in
operation.</p>

<p>General lines of investigation were indicated by the Director, and
the details intrusted to selected persons trained in their several
pursuits, the results of whose labors are published from time to time in
the manner provided for by law. A&nbsp;brief statement of the work upon
which each of these special students was engaged during the year, with
its condensed result, is presented below. This, however, does not
specify in detail all of the studies undertaken or services rendered by
them, as particular lines of research have been temporarily suspended in
order to accomplish immediately objects regarded as of superior
importance. From this cause the publication of several treatises and
monographs has been delayed, although in some instances they have been
heretofore reported as substantially completed, and, indeed, as partly
in type.</p>

<p>The present opportunity is used to invite and urge again the
assistance of explorers, writers, and students, who are not and
<span class = "pagenum">XVI</span>
<a name = "pageXVI" id = "pageXVI"> </a>
may not desire to be officially connected with this Bureau. Their
contributions, whether in the shape of suggestion or of extended
communications, will be gratefully acknowledged and carefully
considered. If published in whole or in part, either in the series of
reports or in monographs or bulletins, as the liberality of Congress may
in future allow, the contributors will always receive proper credit.</p>

<p>The items which form the subject of the present report are presented
in two principal divisions. The first relates to the work prosecuted in
the field, and the second to the office work, which consists largely of
the preparation for publication of the results of the field work,
complemented and extended by study of the literature of the several
subjects and by correspondence relating to them.</p>

FIELD WORK.</a></h5>

<p>This heading may be divided into, first, Mound Explorations; second,
Explorations in Stone Villages; and, third, General Field Studies, among
which those upon mythology, linguistics, and customs have been during
the year the most prominent.</p>

WORK OF PROF. CYRUS THOMAS.</a></h6>

<p>The work of the mound-exploring division, under the charge of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, was carried on during the fiscal year with the same
success that had attended its earlier operations.</p>

<p>It is proper to explain that the title given above to the division
does not fully indicate the extent of its work. The simple exploration
of mounds is but a part of its scope, which embraces, as contemplated in
its organization, a&nbsp;careful examination and study of the
archeologic remains in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.
The limitation of the force engaged on this work renders it necessary
that the investigations should be conducted along but one or two
selected lines at a time.</p>

<p>Before and even during some portion of the year now
<span class = "pagenum">XVII</span>
<a name = "pageXVII" id = "pageXVII"> </a>
reported upon attention had been devoted almost exclusively to the
exploration of individual mounds, with a view of ascertaining the
different types of tumuli, as regards form, construction, and other
particulars and the vestiges of art and human remains found in them. The
study of these works in their relation to each other and their
segregation into groups, and of the mural works, inclosures, and works
of defense, is important in the attempt to obtain indications of the
social life and customs of the builders. This plan of study had not
received the attention desirable and involved the necessity of careful
surveys. It was thought best to make a commencement this year in this
branch of investigation.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1885 Prof. Thomas was in Wisconsin, engaged in
investigating and studying the effigy mounds and other ancient works of
that section.</p>

<p>Messrs. James D. Middleton, John P. Rogan, and John W. Emmert were
permanent assistants during the year; Mr. Charles M. Smith, Rev.
S.&nbsp;D. Peet, and Mr. H.&nbsp;L. Reynolds were employed for short
periods as temporary assistants.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of 1885 Messrs. Middleton and Emmert
were at work on the mounds and ancient monuments of southwestern
Wisconsin, the former surveying the groups of effigy mounds and the
latter exploring the conical tumuli. When the weather became too cold
for operations in that section they were transferred to east Tennessee,
where Mr. Emmert continued at work throughout the remainder of the
fiscal year.</p>

<p>When it had been decided to commence the preparation of a report on
the field work of the division, in the hope of its early publication,
Mr. Middleton was called to the office to assist in that preparation,
where he remained, preparing maps and plats and making a catalogue of
the collections, until the latter part of April, 1886, when he again
entered upon field work in the southern part of Illinois, among the
graves of that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogan was in charge of the office work from the 1st of July until
the latter part of August, during which time Prof. Thomas was in the
field, as before mentioned. He was engaged
<span class = "pagenum">XVIII</span>
<a name = "pageXVIII" id = "pageXVIII"> </a>
during the remainder of the year in exploring the mounds of northern
Georgia and east Tennessee.</p>

<p>Rev. S. D. Peet was employed for a few months in preparing a
preliminary map showing the localities of the antiquarian remains of
Wisconsin and the areas formerly occupied by the several Indian tribes
which are known to have inhabited that region. In addition he prepared
for use in the report notes on the distribution and character of the
mounds and other ancient works of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was engaged during the month of June, 1886, in exploring
mounds and investigating the ancient works in southwestern Pennsylvania;
and Mr. Reynolds, during the same time, in tracing and exploring the
monumental remains of western New York.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the details necessary for office work in the
preparation of maps and plats for the report, and cataloguing the
collection, the amount of field work accomplished was equal to that done
in previous years. Although, as before stated, one of the assistants,
Mr. Middleton, was chiefly engaged, while in the field, in surveying,
about 3,500 specimens were collected and a large number of drawings
obtained illustrating the different modes of construction of the
mounds.</p>

WORK OF DIRECTOR J. W. POWELL.</a></h6>

<p>During the summer of 1885 the Director, accompanied by Mr. James
Stevenson, revisited portions of Arizona and New Mexico in which many
structures are found which have greatly interested travelers and
anthropologists, and about which various theories have grown. The
results of the investigation have been so much more distinct and
comprehensive than any before obtained that they require to be reported
with some detail.</p>

<p>On the plain to the west of the Little Colorado River and north of
the San Francisco Mountain there are many scattered ruins, usually
having one, two, or three rooms each, all of which are built of basaltic
cinders and blocks. Through the plain a valley runs to the north, and
then east to the Little Colorado.
<span class = "pagenum">XIX</span>
<a name = "pageXIX" id = "pageXIX"> </a>
Down the midst of the valley there is a wash, through which, in seasons
of great rainfall, a&nbsp;stream courses. Along this stream there are
extensive ruins built of sandstone and limestone. At one place a village
site was discovered, in which several hundred people once found shelter.
To the north of this and about twenty-five miles from the summit of San
Francisco Peak there is a volcanic cone of cinder and basalt. This small
cone had been used as the site of a village, a&nbsp;pueblo having been
built around the crater. The materials of construction were derived from
a great sandstone quarry near by, and the pit from which they were taken
was many feet in depth and extended over two or three acres of ground.
The cone rises on the west in a precipitous cliff from the valley of an
intermittent creek. The pueblo was built on that side at the summit of
the cliff, and extending on the north and south sides along the summit
of steep slopes, was inclosed on the east, so that the plaza was entered
by a covered way. The court, or plaza, was about one-third of an acre in
area. The little pueblo contained perhaps sixty or seventy rooms.
Southward of San Francisco Mountain many other ruins were found.</p>

<p>East of the San Francisco Peak, at a distance of about twelve miles,
another cinder cone was found. Here the cinders are soft and friable,
and the cone is a prettily shaped dome. On the southern slope there are
excavations into the indurated and coherent cinder mass, constituting
chambers, often ten or twelve feet in diameter and six to ten feet in
height. The chambers are of irregular shape, and occasionally a larger
central chamber forms a kind of vestibule to several smaller ones
gathered about it. The smaller chambers are sometimes at the same
altitude as the central or principal one, and sometimes at a lower
altitude. About one hundred and fifty of these chambers have been
excavated. Most of them are now partly filled by the caving in of the
walls and ceilings, but some of them are yet in a good state of
preservation. In these chambers, and about them on the summit and sides
of the cinder cone, many stone implements were found, especially
metates. Some bone implements also were discovered. At the very summit
of the little cone there is a plaza, inclosed by a rude wall made
<span class = "pagenum">XX</span>
<a name = "pageXX" id = "pageXX"> </a>
of volcanic cinders, the floor of which was carefully leveled. The plaza
is about forty-five by seventy-five feet in area. Here the people lived
in underground houses&mdash;chambers hewn from the friable volcanic
cinders. Before them, to the south, west, and north, stretched beautiful
valleys, beyond which volcanic cones are seen rising amid pine forests.
The people probably cultivated patches of ground in the low valleys.</p>

<p>About eighteen miles still farther to the east of San Francisco
Mountain another ruined village was discovered, built about the crater
of a volcanic cone. This volcanic peak is of much greater magnitude. The
crater opens to the eastward. On the south many stone dwellings have
been built of the basaltic and cinder-like rocks. Between the ridge on
the south and another on the northwest there is a low saddle in which
other buildings have been erected, and in which a great plaza was found,
much like the one previously described. But the most interesting part of
this village was on the cliff which rose on the northwest side of the
crater. In this cliff are many natural caves, and the caves themselves
were utilized as dwellings by inclosing them in front with walls made of
volcanic rocks and cinders. These cliff dwellings are placed tier above
tier, in a very irregular way. In many cases natural caves were thus
utilized; in other cases cavate chambers were made; that is, chambers
have been excavated in the friable cinders. On the very summit of the
ridge stone buildings were erected, so that this village was in part a
cliff village, in part cavate, and in part the ordinary stone pueblo.
The valley below, especially to the southward, was probably occupied by
their gardens. In the chambers among the overhanging cliffs a great many
interesting relics were found, of stone, bone, and wood, and many
potsherds.</p>

<p>About eight miles southeast of Flagstaff, a&nbsp;little town on the
southern slope of San Francisco Mountain, Oak Creek enters a canyon,
which runs to the eastward and then southward for a distance of about
ten miles. The gorge is a precipitous box canyon for the greater part of
this distance. It is cut through carboniferous rocks&mdash;sandstones
and limestones&mdash;which are here nearly horizontal. The softer
sandstones rapidly disintegrate,
<span class = "pagenum">XXI</span>
<a name = "pageXXI" id = "pageXXI"> </a>
and the harder sandstones and limestones remain. Thus broad shelves are
formed on the sides of the cliffs, and these shelves, or the deep
recesses between them, were utilized, so that here is a village of cliff
dwellings. There are several hundred rooms altogether. The rooms are of
sandstone, pretty carefully worked and laid in mortar, and the interior
of the rooms was plastered. The opening for the chimney was usually by
the side of the entrance, and the ceilings of the rooms are still
blackened with soot and smoke. Around this village, on the terrace of
the canyon, great numbers of potsherds, stone implements, and implements
of bone, horn, and wood were found; and here, as in all of the other
ruins mentioned, corncobs in great abundance were discovered.</p>

<p>In addition to the four principal ruins thus described many others
are found, most of them being of the ordinary pueblo type. From the
evidence presented it would seem that they had all been occupied at a
comparatively late date. They were certainly not abandoned more than
three or four centuries ago.</p>

<p>Later in the season the Director visited the Supai Indians of
Cataract Canyon, and was informed by them that their present home had
been taken up not many generations ago, and that their ancestors
occupied the ruins which have been described; and they gave such a
circumstantial account of the occupation and of their expulsion by the
Spaniards, that no doubt can be entertained of the truth of their
traditions in this respect. The Indians of Cataract Canyon doubtless
lived on the north, east, and south of San Francisco Mountain at the
time this country was discovered by the Spaniards, and they subsequently
left their cliff and cavate dwellings and moved into Cataract Canyon,
where they now live. It is thus seen that these cliff and cavate
dwellings are not of an ancient prehistoric time, but that they were
occupied by a people still existing, who also built pueblos of the
common type.</p>

<p>Later in the season the party visited the cavate ruins near Santa
Clara, previously explored by Mr. Stevenson. Here, on the western side
of the Rio Grande del Norte, was found a system of volcanic peaks,
constituting what is known as the
<span class = "pagenum">XXII</span>
<a name = "pageXXII" id = "pageXXII"> </a>
Valley Range. To the east of these peaks, stretching far beyond the
present channel of the Rio Grande, there was once a great Tertiary lake,
which was gradually filled with the sands washed into it on every hand
and by the ashes blown out of the adjacent volcanoes. This great lake
formation is in some places a thousand feet in thickness. When the lake
was filled the Rio Grande cut its channel through the midst to a depth
of many hundreds of feet. The volcanic mountains to the westward send to
the Rio Grande a number of minor streams, which in a general way are
parallel with one another. The Rio Grande itself, and all of these
lateral streams, have cut deep gorges and canyons, so that there are
long, irregular table-lands, or mesas, extending from the Rio Grande
back to the Valley Mountains, each mesa being severed from the adjacent
one by a canyon or canyon valley; and each of these long mesas rises
with a precipitous cliff from the valley below. The cliffs themselves
are built of volcanic sands and ashes, and many of the strata are
exceedingly light and friable. The specific gravity of some of these
rocks is so low that they will float on water. Into the faces of these
cliffs, in the friable and easily worked rock, many chambers have been
excavated; for mile after mile the cliffs are studded with them, so that
altogether there are many thousands. Sometimes a chamber or series of
chambers is entered from a terrace, but usually they were excavated many
feet above any landing or terrace below, so that they could be reached
only by ladders. In other places artificial terraces were built by
constructing retaining walls and filling the interior next to the cliff
with loose rock and sand. Very often steps were cut into the face of a
cliff and a rude stairway formed by which chambers could be reached. The
chambers were very irregularly arranged and very irregular in size and
structure. In many cases there is a central chamber, which seems to have
been a general living room for the people, back of which two, three, or
more chambers somewhat smaller are found. The chambers occupied by one
family are sometimes connected with those occupied by another family, so
that two or three or four sets of chambers have interior communication.
Usually, however, the communication from one system of
<span class = "pagenum">XXIII</span>
<a name = "pageXXIII" id = "pageXXIII"> </a>
chambers to another was by the outside. Many of the chambers had
evidently been occupied as dwellings. They still contained fireplaces
and evidences of fire; there were little caverns or shelves in which
various vessels were placed, and many evidences of the handicraft of the
people were left in stone, bone, horn, and wood, and in the chambers and
about the sides of the cliffs potsherds are abundant. On more careful
survey it was found that many chambers had been used as stables for
asses, goats, and sheep. Sometimes they had been filled a few inches, or
even two or three feet, with the excrement of these animals. Ears of
corn and corncobs were also found in many places. Some of the chambers
were evidently constructed to be used as storehouses or caches for
grain. Altogether it is very evident that the cliff houses have been
used in comparatively modern times; at any rate since the people owned
asses, goats, and sheep. The rock is of such a friable nature that it
will not stand atmospheric degradation very long, and there is abundant
evidence of this character testifying to the recent occupancy of these
cavate dwellings.</p>

<p>Above the cliffs, on the mesas, which have already been described,
evidences of more ancient ruins were found. These were pueblos built of
cut stone rudely dressed. Every mesa had at least one ancient pueblo
upon it, evidently far more ancient than the cavate dwellings found in
the face of the cliffs. It is, then, very plain that the cavate
dwellings are not of great age; that they have been occupied since the
advent of the white man, and that on the summit of the cliffs there are
ruins of more ancient pueblos.</p>

<p>Now, the pottery of Santa Clara had been previously studied by Mr.
Stevenson, who made a large collection there two or three years ago, and
it was at once noticed that the potsherds of these cliff dwellings are,
both in shape and material, like those now made by the Santa Clara
Indians. The peculiar pottery of Santa Clara is readily distinguished,
as may be seen by examining the collection now in the National Museum.
While encamped in the valley below, the party met a Santa Clara Indian
and engaged him in conversation. From him the history of the cliff
dwellings was soon obtained. His statement was that originally his
people lived in six pueblos, built of cut stone,
<span class = "pagenum">XXIV</span>
<a name = "pageXXIV" id = "pageXXIV"> </a>
upon the summit of the mesas; that there came a time when they were at
war with the Apaches and Navajos, when they abandoned their stone
pueblos above and for greater protection excavated the chambers in the
cliffs below; that when this war ended part of them returned to the
pueblos above, which were rebuilt; that there afterward came another
war, with the Comanche Indians, and they once more resorted to cliff
dwellings. At the close of this war they built a pueblo in the valley of
the Rio Grande, but at the time of the invasion of the Spaniards their
people refused to be baptized, and a Spanish army was sent against them,
when they abandoned the valley below and once more inhabited the cliff
dwellings above. Here they lived many years, until at last a wise and
good priest brought them peace, and persuaded them to build the pueblo
which they now occupy&mdash;the village of Santa Clara. The ruin of the
pueblo which they occupied previous to the invasion of the Spaniards is
still to be seen about a mile distant from the present pueblo.</p>

<p>The history thus briefly given was repeated by the governor and by
other persons, all substantially to the same effect. It is therefore
evident that the cavate dwellings of the Santa Clara region belong to a
people still extant; that they are not of great antiquity, and do not
give evidence of a prehistoric and now extinct race.</p>

<p>Plans and measurements were made of some of the villages with
sufficient accuracy to prepare models. Photographic views and sketches
were also procured with which to illustrate a detailed report of the
subject to be published by the Bureau.</p>

WORK OF MR. JAMES STEVENSON.</a></h6>

<p>After the investigations made in company with the Director, as
mentioned above, Mr. Stevenson proceeded with a party to the ancient
province of Tusayan, in Arizona, to study the characteristics of the
Moki tribes, its inhabitants, and to make collections of such implements
and utensils as illustrate their arts and industries. Several months
were spent among the villages, resulting in a large collection of rare
objects, all of which were selected with special reference to their
anthropologic

importance. This collection contains many articles novel in character
and with uses differing from any heretofore obtained, and forms an
important addition to the collections in the National Museum.</p>

<p>A study of their religious ceremonials and mythology was made, of
which full notes were taken. Sketches were made of their masks and other
objects which could not be obtained for the collection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevenson was also enabled to obtain a minute description of the
celebrated dance, or medicine ceremony, of the Navajos, called the
Yéibit-cai. She made complete sketches of the sand altars, masks, and
other objects employed in this ceremonial.</p>

WORK OF MESSRS. VICTOR MINDELEFF AND COSMOS MINDELEFF.</a></h6>

<p>Mr. Victor Mindeleff, who had been engaged for several years in
investigating the architecture of the pueblos and the ruins of the
southwest, was at the beginning of the fiscal year at work among the
Moki towns in Arizona, in charge of a party. Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff left
Washington on July 6 for the same locality. He was placed in charge of
the surveying necessary in the Stone Village region, and the result of
his work is included in the general report of that division.</p>

<p>Visits were paid to the Moki villages in succession, obtaining
drawings of some constructional details, and also traditions bearing on
the ruins in that vicinity. The main camp was established near
Mashongnavi, one of the Moki villages. A&nbsp;large ruined pueblo,
formerly occupied by the Mashongnavi, was here surveyed. No standing
walls are found at the present time, and many portions of the plan are
entirely obliterated. Typical fragments of pottery were collected.</p>

<p>Following this work, four other ruined pueblos were surveyed, and
such portions of them as clearly indicated dividing walls were drawn on
the ground plans.</p>

<p>Many of the ruins in this vicinity, according to the traditions of
the Mokis, have been occupied in comparatively recent times&mdash;-a
number of them having been abandoned since the Spanish conquest of the
country. In several cases the villages
<span class = "pagenum">XXVI</span>
<a name = "pageXXVI" id = "pageXXVI"> </a>
now occupied are not upon the same sites as those first visited by the
Spaniards, although retaining the same names.</p>

<p>While the work of surveying was in progress, in charge of Mr. Cosmos
Mindeleff, Mr. Victor Mindeleff made a visit of several days at Keam
Canyon, there to meet a number of the Navajo Indians to explain the
purpose of the work and allay the suspicions of these Indians,
a&nbsp;necessary precaution, as some of the proposed work was laid out
in Canyon de Chelly, in the heart of their reservation. Recent
restrictions to which they had been subjected, as a consequence of new
surveys of the reservation line, had made them especially distrustful of
parties equipped with instruments for surveying. Incidental to
explanations of the purpose of the work, an opportunity was afforded of
obtaining a number of mythologic notes, and also interesting data
regarding the construction of their “hogans,” with the rules prescribing
the arrangement of each part of the frame and other particulars.
A&nbsp;number of ceremonial songs are sung at the building of these
houses, but of these only one could be secured, which was obtained in
the original and translated. Whenever opportunity occurred, during the
progress of the work, photographs and diagrams of construction of
“hogans” were procured.</p>

<p>On August 17 the ceremony of the snake-dance took place at
Mashongnavi, similar in every detail to that performed at Walpi, and
differing only in the number of participants. Several instantaneous
negatives of the various phases of the dance were secured. On the
following day the same ceremony was performed on a larger scale at
Walpi, the easternmost of the Moki villages.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff assisted in collecting from the present
inhabitants of the region legendary information bearing upon ruins and
in observing the snake-dances, a&nbsp;description of which was prepared
for publication.</p>

<p>While the surveys of the ruins were in progress many detailed studies
were made of special features in the modern villages, particularly among
the “kivas” or religious chambers. In several instances the large
roofing timbers of the “kiva” were found to be the old beams from the
Spanish churches,
<span class = "pagenum">XXVII</span>
<a name = "pageXXVII" id = "pageXXVII"> </a>
hewn square, and decorated with the characteristic rude carving of the
old Spanish work. A&nbsp;number of legends connected with the ruined
pueblos were recorded.</p>

<p>On closing this work in the vicinity of the Moki villages, late in
August, the party moved into Keam Canyon, en route for Canyon de Chelly.
A&nbsp;day was devoted to the survey of a small pueblo of irregular
elliptical outline, situated about eighteen miles northeast from Keam
Canyon. This ruin is in excellent state of preservation and exhibits in
the masonry some stones of remarkably large size. The early part of
September was employed in making a close survey of the Mummy Cave group
of ruins in Canyon de la Muerte, this work including a five-foot contour
map of the ground and the rocky ledge over which the houses were
distributed. Detailed drawings of a number of special features were made
here, particularly in connection with the circular ceremonial chambers.
The latter were so buried under the accumulated debris of fallen walls
that much excavation was required to lay bare the details of internal
arrangement. A&nbsp;high class of workmanship is here exhibited, both in
the execution of the constructional features and in the interior
decoration of these chambers. Later the White House group, in the Canyon
de Chelly, comprising a village and cliff houses, was examined and
platted in the same manner.</p>

<p>The drawings and plans were supplemented with a series of
photographs. Some negatives of Navajo houses were also made.</p>

<p>On closing this work the party went into Fort Defiance, en route for
Zuñi, and thence to Ojo Caliente, a&nbsp;modern farming pueblo of the
Zuñi, about twelve miles south of the principal village. Here two ruins
of villages, thought to belong to the ancient Cibola group, were
platted. One of these villages had been provided with a circular
reservoir of large size, partially walled in with masonry. Here, also,
the well preserved walls of a stone church can be seen. The other
contains the remains of a large church, built of adobe. A&nbsp;series of
widely scattered house-clusters, occurring two miles west of Ojo
Caliente, was also examined, but the earth had drifted over the fallen
walls
<span class = "pagenum">XXVIII</span>
<a name = "pageXXVIII" id = "pageXXVIII"> </a>
and so covered them that the arrangement of rooms could scarcely be
traced at all.</p>

<p>The modern village of Ojo Caliente was also surveyed and diagrams and
photographs made.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September camp was moved to the vicinity of Zuñi.
Here four other villages of the Cibola group and the old villages on the
mesa of Ta-ai-ya-lo-ne were examined. Camp was then moved to Nutria,
a&nbsp;farming pueblo of Zuñi. From this camp Nutria was surveyed and
photographed, and also the village of Pescado, which is occupied only
during the farming season. Both of these modern farming pueblos appear
to be built on the ruins of more ancient villages, the remains of which
were especially noticeable in the case of Pescado, where the very
carefully executed masonry, characteristic of the ancient methods of
construction, could be seen outcropping at many points.</p>

<p>Following the return of the main party to Washington, some
preliminary exploration was carried on by Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson, who
made an examination of the headwaters of the South Fork of Salt River,
but did not find any ruins. Thence the Blue Ridge was crossed, and the
valley of the Blue Fork of the San Francisco River visited. Here ruins
were frequently increasing in number toward the south. Farther south
three sets of cliff ruins were also located.</p>

WORK OF DR. H. C. YARROW.</a></h6>

<p>During the summer and fall of 1885, Dr. H.&nbsp;C. Yarrow, acting
assistant surgeon U.S. Army, examined points in Arizona and Utah. In the
vicinity of Springerville, Apache County, Arizona, in company with Mr.
E.&nbsp;W. Nelson, he visited a number of ancient pueblos and discovered
that the people formerly occupying the towns had followed the custom of
burying their dead immediately outside the walls of their habitations,
marking the places of sepulcher with circles of stones.
<span class = "pagenum">XXIX</span>
<a name = "pageXXIX" id = "pageXXIX"> </a>
The graves were four or five feet in depth, and various household
utensils had been deposited with the dead. Mr. Nelson, who had made a
careful search for these cemeteries, informed him of the locality of
hundreds. Unfortunately for anthropometric science, most of the bones
are too much decayed to be of practical value. The places of burial
selected at these pueblos are similar to the burial places discovered in
1874 near the large ruined pueblo of Abiquiu, in the valley of the
Chama, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Yarrow also visited the Moki pueblos in Arizona, and obtained
from one of the principal men a clear and succinct account of their
burial customs. While there he witnessed the famous snake dance, which
occurs every two years, and is supposed to have the effect of producing
rain. From his knowledge of the reptilian fauna of the country he was
able to identify the species of serpents used in the dance, and from
personal examination satisfied himself that the fangs had not been
extracted from the poisonous varieties. He thinks, however, that the
reptiles are somewhat tamed by handling during the four days that they
are kept in the estufas and possibly are made to eject the greater part
of the venom contained in the sacs at the roots of the teeth, by being
teased and forced to strike at different objects held near them. He does
not think that a vegetable decoction in which they are washed has a
stupefying effect, as has been supposed by some. He also obtained from a
Moki high priest a full account of the ceremonies attending the dance.
Through the assistance of Mr. Thomas V. Keam, of Keam Canyon, Arizona,
and Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen, he was able to procure from a noted Navajo
wise man an exact account of the burial customs of his people, as well
as valuable information regarding their medical practices, especially
such as relate to obstetrics.</p>

<p>From Arizona Dr. Yarrow proceeded to Utah, and made an examination of
an old rock cemetery near Farmington, finding it similar to the one he
discovered in 1872 near the town of Fillmore. The bodies had been
carried far up the side of the mountain; cavities had been prepared in a
rock slide, and the bodies placed therein. Branches of cottonwood were
then laid
<span class = "pagenum">XXX</span>
<a name = "pageXXX" id = "pageXXX"> </a>
over and large boulders piled on top. In several of these graves the
skeletons were in a fair state of preservation, and were removed, as
well as the articles found with them.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mr. William Young, of Grantsville,
a&nbsp;skeleton of a Gosiute, in excellent preservation, was obtained,
and has been presented to the Army Medical Museum. It may be stated that
the examination of the rock cemetery at Farmington showed that the
inhabitants of the eastern slope of the Wahsatch Range, in Great Salt
Lake Valley, followed the mode of rock sepulture from this, the most
northern point visited, to below Parowan, a&nbsp;distance of at least
two hundred miles southward, and it seems that these people occupied the
valley long subsequent to those living near the water courses who
constructed the small mounds on top of which were the rude adobe
dwellings, and in some instances used these huts for burial
purposes.</p>

SYNONYMY OF INDIAN TRIBES.</a></h5>

<p>The Director has before reported in general terms that the most
serious source of perplexity to the student of the history of the North
American Indians is the confusion existing among their tribal names. The
causes of this confusion are various. The Indian names for themselves
have been understood and recorded in diverse ways by the earlier
authors, and have been variously transmitted by the latter. Nicknames
arising from trivial causes, and often without apparent cause, have been
imposed upon many tribes. Names borne by one tribe at some period of its
history have been transferred to another, or to several other distinct
tribes. Typographical errors, and improved
<span class = "pagenum">XXXV</span>
<a name = "pageXXXV" id = "pageXXXV"> </a>
spelling on assumed phonetic grounds, have swelled the number of
synonyms until the investigator of a special tribe often finds himself
in a maze of nomenclatural perplexity.</p>

<p>It has long been the intention of the Director to prepare a work on
tribal names, which so far as possible should refer their confusing
titles to a correct and systematic standard. Delay has been occasioned
chiefly by the fundamental necessity of defining linguistic stocks or
families into which all tribes must be primarily divided; and to
accomplish this, long journeys and laborious field and office
investigations have been required during the whole time since the
establishment of the Bureau. Though a few points still remained in an
unsatisfactory condition, it was considered that a sufficient degree of
accuracy had been attained to allow of the publication for the benefit
of students of a volume devoted to the subject. The preparation of the
plan of such a volume was intrusted to Mr. H.&nbsp;W. Henshaw, late in
the spring of 1885, and in June of that year the work was energetically
begun in accordance with the plans submitted. The preparation of this
work, which to a great extent underlies and is the foundation for every
field of ethnologic investigation among Indians, was considered of such
prime importance that nearly all the available force of the Bureau was
placed upon it, to the suspension of the particular investigations in
which the several officers had been engaged.</p>

<p>In addition to the general charge of the whole work, Mr. Henshaw gave
special attention to the families of the northwest coast from Oregon
northward, including the Eskimo, and also several in California. To Mr.
Albert S. Gatschet the tribes of the southeastern United States,
together with the Pueblo and Yuman tribes, were assigned. The Algonkian
family in all its branches&mdash;by far the most important part of the
whole, so far as the great bulk of literature relating to it is
concerned&mdash;was intrusted to Col. Garrick Mallery and Mr. James
Mooney. They also took charge of the Iroquoian family. Rev. J.&nbsp;O.
Dorsey’s intimate acquaintance with the tribes of the Siouan and Caddoan
families peculiarly fitted him to cope with that part of the work, and
he also undertook the Athapascan tribes.

Dr. W.&nbsp;J. Hoffman worked upon the Shoshonean tribes, aided by the
Director’s personal supervision. Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, to whom was
assigned the California tribes, also gave assistance in other
sections.</p>

<p>Each of the gentlemen named has been able to contribute largely to
the results by his personal experience and investigations in the field,
there being numerous regions concerning which published accounts are
meager and unsatisfactory. The main source of the material to be dealt
with has, however, been necessarily derived from books. A&nbsp;vast
amount of the current literature pertaining to the North American
Indians has been examined, amounting to over one thousand volumes, with
a view to the extraction of the tribal names and the historical data
necessary to fix their precise application.</p>

<p>The work at the present time is well advanced toward completion. The
examination of literature for the collation of synonyms may be regarded
as practically done. The tables of synonymy and the accounts of the
tribes have been completed for more than one-half the number of
linguistic families.</p>

LINGUISTIC FAMILIES OF NORTH AMERICA.</a></h6>

<p>In harmony with custom, three scientific papers accompany this
report, designed to illustrate the nature, methods and spirit of the
researches conducted by the Bureau. The first is on the “Classification
of the North American Languages.” It is by no means a final paper on the
subject, but is intended rather to give an account of the present status
of the subject, and to place before the workers in this field of
scholarship the data now existing and the conclusions already reached,
so as to constitute a point of departure for new work. With this end in
view Mr. Pilling is engaged upon the bibliography of the subject and is
rapidly publishing the same, and Mr. Henshaw is employed on the tribal
synonymy. Altogether it is hoped that this work will inaugurate a new
era in the investigation of the subject by making available the vast
body of
<span class = "pagenum">XXXVII</span>
<a name = "pageXXXVII" id = "pageXXXVII"> </a>
material scattered broadcast through the literature relating to the
North American Indians.</p>

<p>In the course of these ethnic researches an interesting field of
facts has been brought to view relating to the superstitions of the
Indians. Already a very large body of mythology has been
collected&mdash;stories from a great number of tongues which embody the
rude philosophy of tribal thought. Such philosophy or opinion finds its
expression not only in the mythic tales, but in the organization of the
people into society, in their daily life and in their habits and
customs. There is a realm of anthropology in this lower state of mankind
which we call savagery, that is hard to understand from the standpoint
of modern civilization, where science, theology, religion, medicine and
the esthetic arts are developed as more or less discrete subjects. In
savagery these great subjects are blended in one, as they are interwoven
into a vast plexus of thought and action, for mythology is the basis of
philosophy, religion, medicine, and art. In savagery the observed facts
of the universe, relating alike to physical nature and to the
humanities, are explained mythologically, and these mythic conceptions
give rise to a great variety of practices. The acts of life are born of
the opinions held as explanations of the environing world. Thus it is
that philosophy finds expression in a complex system of superstitions,
ceremonies and practices, which together constitute the religion of the
people. The purpose of these practices is to avert calamity and to
secure prosperity in the present life. It is astonishing to find how
little the condition of a life to come is involved. The future beyond
the grave is scarcely heeded, or when recognized it seems not to affect
the daily life of the people to any appreciable degree. That which
occupies the attention of the savage mind relates to the pleasures and
pains, the joys and sorrows of present existence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief motive is derived from the consideration of health
and disease, as the pleasures and pains arising therefrom are forever
present to the experience or observation. Good and evil are also
involved in those gifts of nature to man by which his biotic life is
sustained, his food, drink, clothing
<span class = "pagenum">XXXVIII</span>
<a name = "pageXXXVIII" id = "pageXXXVIII"> </a>
and shelter. These bounties come not in a never-changing stream, but are
apparently fitful and capricious. Seasons of plenty are accented by
seasons of scarcity, and thus prosperity and adversity are strangely
commingled in the history of the people. To secure this prosperity and
avert this adversity seems to be the second great motive in the
development of the superstitious practices of the people. A&nbsp;third
occasion for the development of this primitive religion inheres in the
social organization of mankind, primarily expressed in the love of man
and woman for each other, but finally expressed in all the relations of
kin and kith and in the relations of tribe with tribe. This gives rise
to a very important development of primitive religion, for the savage
man seeks to discover by occult agencies the power of controlling the
love and good will of his kind and the power of averting the effect of
enmity. To attain these ends he invents a vast system of devices, from
love philters to war dances. A&nbsp;fourth region of exploitation in the
realm of the esoteric relates to the origin of life itself, as many of
their practices are designed to secure perpetuity of life by frequent
births and less painful throes.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that life, health, prosperity, and peace are the
ends sought in all this region of human activity as they are presented
in the study of savage life. The opinions held by the people on these
subjects are primarily expressed in speech and organized into tales,
which constitute mythology, and they are expressed in acts, as
ceremonies and observances, which constitute their religion, their
medicine, and their esthetic arts. These arts consist of sculpture and
painting, by which their mythic beings are represented, and they also
consist of dancing, by which religious fervor is produced, and they give
rise to music, romance, poetry, and drama. Thus it is that the esthetic
arts have their origin in mythology. The epic poem and the symphony are
lineal descendants of the dance, and the dance arises as the first form
of worship, born of the mythic conception of the powers of nature.</p>

THE MIDĒ´WIWIN, OR GRAND MEDICINE SOCIETY OF THE OJIBWA, BY W.&nbsp;J.
HOFFMAN, AND THE SACRED FORMULAS OF THE CHEROKEES, BY JAMES
MOONEY.</a></h6>

<p>Mr. Hoffman presents a paper on the “Midē´wiwin, or Grand Medicine
Society of the Ojibwa,” and sets forth the vestiges of a once powerful
organization existing among these people. Mr. Mooney has made a study of
the Cherokee with the same end in view. In the opinion of the Director
they are important contributions to this subject. The same lines of
investigation have been carried on by other members of the Bureau with
other tribes where societies and practices have been but little modified
by the contact of the white man, and where the subject is therefore much
more plainly arrayed. In due time these additional researches will be
published.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hoffman’s paper it is seen that two and a half centuries of
association with the white man has not only served to break down this
organization to some extent, but has also inculcated in the minds of the
Ojibwa a clearer conception of a Great Spirit and a future life than is
normal to the savage mind. Mr. Mooney, whose paper largely deals with
the use of plants by the Indians for the healing of disease, naïvely
compares the pharmacopoeia of savagery with that of civilization,
assuming that the latter is a standard of scientific truth. Perchance
scientific men will make one step in advance of this position, and will
be interested in discovering the extent to which savage philosophy is
still represented in civilized materia medica as expressed in <ins class
= "correction" title = "not an error">officinal</ins> formulas.</p>

<p>A word in relation to the dramatis personæ of Indian mythology. In
all those mythologies which have been studied with any degree of care up
to the present time zoic deities greatly prevail, the progenitors and
prototypes of the animals of the land, air, and water; yet there are
other deities. Chief among these are the sun, moon, stars, fire, and the
spirits of mountains and other geographical and natural phenomena. Yet
these beings are largely zoomorphic, being considered rather as mythic
animals than as mythic men; but it must be understood that the line of
demarcation between man and the lower animals is not so clearly
presented to the savage mind
<span class = "pagenum">XL</span>
<a name = "pageXL" id = "pageXL"> </a>
as to the civilized mind. In speaking of the theology of the North
American Indians as being zoomorphic it must therefore be understood to
mean that such is its chief characteristic, but not its exclusive
characteristic; and further, it must be understood that it contains by
survival many elements from an earlier condition in which hecastotheism
prevailed, that is, that the form of philosophy known as animism was
generally accepted, and that psychic life, with feeling, thought, and
will, was attributed to inanimate things. But more than this, zootheism
is not a permanent state of philosophy, but only a stepping-stone to
something higher. That something higher may be denominated physitheism,
or the worship of the powers and more obtrusive phenomena of nature. In
this higher state the sun, the planets, the stars, the winds, the
storms, the rainbow, and fire take the leading part. The beginnings of
this higher state are to be observed in many of the mythologies of North
America. It is worthy of remark that a mythology with its religion
subject to the influences of an overwhelming civilization yields first
in its zoomorphic elements. Zoic mythology soon degenerates into folk
tales of beasts, to be recited by crones to children or told by
garrulous old men as amusing stories inherited from past generations;
while physitheism is more often incorporated into the compound of
paganism and Christianity now held by the more advanced tribes.
Notwithstanding this general tendency, zootheism is often, though not to
so great an extent, compounded in the same way. The study of this stage
of mythology, and of the arts and customs arising therefrom, as they are
exhibited among the North American Indians, will ultimately throw a
flood of light upon that later stage known as physitheism, or nature
worship, now the subject of investigation by an army of Aryan
scholars.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
